This app makes solving leetcode problems a fun adventure.

## Story Design Architecture Method

This project uses the story driven approach to design systems ensuring documentation is provided with proper context, examples, and other factors along with the code.

This approach is inspired by Donald Knuth's Literate Programming but updated for modern audiences.

## Story

- [ ] TODO: ordinary world: Establish setting, characters (users, system), status quo.
- [ ] TODO: call to adventure: The problem/opportunity disrupts the status quo.
- [ ] TODO: (Often within Call to Adventure): Hesitation, fear, or initial failed solutions.
- [ ] TODO: meeting mentor: Introduction to tools, principles, or wisdom (e.g., a new algorithm, uv, best practices).
- [ ] TODO: crossing threshold: First real commitment—writing the first lines of the new solution.
- [ ] TODO: tests trials allies: Early challenges, debugging, finding helpful libraries/techniques.
- [ ] TODO: approach in most cave: Preparing for the core challenge—tackling the main algorithm's complexity.
- [ ] TODO: ordeal resurrection: The central crisis—a major bug, performance hurdle—faced and overcome.
- [ ] TODO: reward road back: Seizing the solution—it works! Initial refinement and validation.
- [ ] TODO: (Often part of Reward): Integrating the solution, dealing with consequences.
- [ ] TODO: (Often fused with Ordeal): Final test that proves the hero/solution has truly changed.
- [ ] TODO: return home: Solution is integrated; the world is improved; lessons are shared.
- [ ] TODO: new normal: Solution is integrated; the world is improved; lessons are shared.
